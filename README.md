# CarCar

The project is CarCar, an application for managing aspects of an automobile dealership â€” specifically its inventory, sales and service center.

Team:

- **John Lukich** - Sales and inventory microservice
- **Shaoda Liu** - Service microservice

## Getting Started

<ins>**Make sure you have Docker, Git, and Node.js 20.11 or above**</ins>

1. Fork this repository

2. Clone the forked repository onto your local computer.

3. Build and run the project using Docker with these commands:

```
docker volume create beta-data
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

- After running these commands, make sure all of your Docker containers are running

- View the project in the browser: http://localhost:3000/

## Design

CarCar is an application made up of 3 individual microservices serving differnet functionalities.

- **Inventory**
- **Sales**
- **Service**

![Img](/images/project-beta-diagram.png)

## Integration

Our Sales and Service domains work individually but they both rely on the APIs provided by the inventory domain to poll the necessary data and make their functionality possible.

## How this starts?

Inventory is the cornerstone. It keeps a automobile table in the database which holding records of vehicles on our lot.

Sales and Service microservices have a **poller** to keep track of the records of the automobile from the Inventory and make them always up-to-date.

# Sales Microservice

This microservice allows users to see, create, and delete the Salespeople, Customers and Sales

On the backend, there are 4 models: AutomobileVO, Salesperson, Customer and Sale.

**Salesperson** is the model that stores the salepeople's first and last names with the employee ids.

**Customer** is the model that stores the customers' first and last names, addresses, and their phone numbers.

**Sale** is the model that stores the records of saleperson, customer, and automobile as foreign keys along with the price of sales.

**AutomobileVO** is a value object that stores the data about the vehicles. The poller automotically polls the Automobile database in Inventory service for data, so the Sales microservice is constantly getting the updated data of automobiles.

# Service microservice

This microservice allows users to see, create, and delete the Technician, and Appointment.

On the backend, there are 3 models: AutomobileVO, Technician, and Appointment.
